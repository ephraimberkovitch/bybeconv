<h2 style="text-align: center;">Information on obtaining or building a
ca-bundle.crt file</h2>
<h3>What is ca-bundle.crt?</h3>
ca-bundle.crt is a file that contains well known root CAcertificates.(<a
 href="http://www.itsecurity.com/asktecs/may2301.htm">What is a root CA?</a>)<br>
<br>
<h3>What is it used for?</h3>
It is used by <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">openssl</a> to validate
certificates issued by well known root CAs. &nbsp;It is also used by any
third party applications that use openssl, and some that don't.<br>
<br>
<h3>Why do I need to get ca-bundle.crt here/Why do I need to build it
myself? &nbsp;Why isn't it provided by (insert your tool here)
developers?</h3>
It was originally produced by Netscape. &nbsp;However, after version
4.x, Netscape no longer uses the ca-bundle.crt format. &nbsp;3rd party
products (like openssl) still <span style="font-weight: bold;">do </span>use
it. &nbsp;Most of the versions of ca-bundle.crt floating around the net
are very old.<br>
<br>
In any case, you may feel safer building it yourself. &nbsp;Building it
yourself lets you decide what root CAs you want to trust.<br>
<br>
<h3>Forget about building it myself, where can I get a pre-built copy?</h3>
Here's one I buiilt using Mozilla's NSS library v3.7 built-in "Builtin
Roots Module" : <a href="/ca-bundle/ca-bundle.crt.txt">ca-bundle.crt<br>
</a><br>

<h3>How do I go about building ca-bundle.crt myself?</h3>
First, you'll need a bunch of root CA certificates that you trust :)<br>
<br>
I recommend getting Mozilla's list. &nbsp;Its destributed in their NSS
sourcecode. &nbsp;Here are the steps/code to produce ca-bundle.crt from
NSS code :<br>
<br>
The following instructions have been tried on Mandrake linux 8.2<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Download Mozilla's NSS code : <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/nss-3.7.1/nss-3.7.1-release-notes.html">nss
3.7 release notes</a></li>
  <li>Download <a href="/ca-bundle/dumpCerts.java">dumpCerts.java</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="/ca-bundle/create_bundle.sh">create_bundle.sh</a> from
certifie.com.</li>
  <li>build dumpCerts.java</li>
  <ul>
    <li>use jss33.jar from NSS<br>
    </li>
    <li>javac -classpath jss33.jar dumpCerts.java</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Install a Mozilla browser.<br>
  </li>
  <li>run dumpCerts.java</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the directory where you have put NSS.
&nbsp;it should point to a directory that has nss/lib under it.</li>
    <li>run : java -classpath .:jss33.jar dumpCerts
$HOME/.mozilla/default/&lt;user dir&gt;.slt/ &nbsp; ca-bundle.crt</li>
  </ul>
  <li>That's it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>I've got some special CA certs not included by Mozilla that I wan't
to add to ca-bundle.crt. &nbsp;How can I add them?</h3>
You can use&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.certifie.com/ca-bundle/create_bundle.sh">create_bundle.sh</a>.
&nbsp;It is called by dumpCerts.java to build the ca-bundle.crt file
from NSS data. &nbsp;It may also be run stand-alone and its output
appended to ca-bundle.crt. &nbsp;You may also want to cut and paste its
output into ca-bundle.crt to keep it alphabetized properly (if your
picky).<br>
<br>
<h3>What license is your code distributed under? &nbsp;Can I use it for
commercial uses?</h3>
You may use the two files&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.certifie.com/ca-bundle/dumpCerts.java">dumpCerts.java</a>
and&nbsp; &nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.certifie.com/ca-bundle/create_bundle.sh">create_bundle.sh</a>
however you'd like, although I make no claims that they will function
correctly. &nbsp;Use them at your own risk. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The file&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.certifie.com/ca-bundle/ca-bundle.crt.txt">ca-bundle.crt</a><a
 href="file:///ca-bundle/ca-bundle.crt"></a> is provided here under the
assumption that it is data/facts and may be used freely by anyone who
wishes to use it.<br>
<br>
<h3>I have some additional questions. &nbsp;How may I contact you to
ask them?<br>
