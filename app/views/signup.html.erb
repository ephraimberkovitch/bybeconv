    <p>
    If you think you already have an account, and you were just trying to associate a new authentication with your existing account, then you’re in the wrong place. You’re not logged in right now.

        If you have an account, and you’d like to associate another authentication with it, here’s what to do:
    </p>
    <ul class="small">
        <li>Log in in with your existing authentication service TODO</li>
        <li>Go to your settings page (located at the top/right corner of the page)
        <li>Add one or more accounts to be used to sign-in</li>
    </ul>
